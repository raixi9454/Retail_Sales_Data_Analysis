## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **pandas** – Data manipulation and cleaning
- **matplotlib** – Data visualization

## 📊 Analysis Overview

The analysis in `cleaned_data.ipynb` includes:

- **Data Loading & Inspection**  
  Initial overview of the retail dataset to understand structure and missing values.

- **Data Cleaning**  
  - Handling missing values  
  - Data type conversions  
  - Removing/renaming columns for clarity

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  - Profit trend analysis over time  
  - Category-wise profit distribution  
  - Revenue vs. profit comparison  
  - Region-wise profit margin analysis

- **Visualizations**  
  Clear and informative visual representations using `matplotlib`, such as:
  - Line graphs (for trends)
  - Bar charts (for comparisons)
  - Pie charts or stacked bars (for distribution)

## 📈 Key Insights

- **Profit Trend Over Time**  
  The analysis revealed a fluctuating profit trend across months/years, indicating seasonal influences and possible supply-demand factors.

- **Overall Profit Distribution by Category**  
  Certain categories significantly outperformed others in terms of profit, highlighting potential focus areas for marketing and inventory investment.

- **Revenue vs. Profit Comparison**  
  Although some products/categories generate high revenue, they do not always correspond to high profit — underscoring the importance of margin analysis.

- **Average Profit Margin by Region**  
  Some regions consistently show higher average profit margins, possibly due to pricing strategies, lower costs, or local demand patterns.

## ✅ How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Install the required libraries if not already available:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib
   ```

3. Open `cleaned_data.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
4. Run each cell sequentially to perform the analysis.

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Integrate with `seaborn` or `plotly` for advanced visualizations.
- Perform predictive modeling for future sales and profit.
- Add dashboarding capability (e.g., with Streamlit or Power BI).
